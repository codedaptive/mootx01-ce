// StatSample.swift
//
// The telemetry datum. A StatSample is either a named metric with a
// floating-point value and tag map, or a topology-worker event that
// records a substrate lifecycle transition.
//
// Design notes:
//   - Timestamps are caller-supplied (epoch seconds as Double) — never
//     read a clock inside IntellectusLib. Determinism is required.
//   - Both variants are value types and Sendable so they can cross
//     actor / task boundaries without copying overhead on the caller.
//   - The tag map uses String keys and String values. Keeping both
//     sides String (rather than, say, Int for nounType tag) keeps the
//     metric variant general-purpose; the event variant uses typed
//     fields where the types are fixed by the topology protocol.

/// All instances are value types and `Sendable`. They may be
/// forwarded across task / actor boundaries without synchronisation
/// overhead on the construction site.
///
/// Timestamps (`ts`) are **caller-supplied epoch seconds** (Double).
/// Never call a clock inside `IntellectusLib`. Pass `Date().timeIntervalSince1970`
/// or any deterministic time source at the call site.

    ///   - name:  Dot-separated metric name, e.g. `"locus.capture.latency_ms"`.
    ///   - value: The measured quantity (count, duration, rate, …).

    /// A topology-worker lifecycle event. Records that a substrate

    /// topology-snapshot duty — consumes the observed estate-event stream

    /// retains these in its bounded recent window (`RecentWindowSink`).
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - kind:      The verb kind: `.capture` or `.think`.
    ///   - nounType:  The NounType ordinal (Int) from SubstrateTypes.
    ///                Passed as Int here to keep IntellectusLib a zero-
    ///                dependency leaf — the caller casts NounType to Int.
    ///   - rowID:     The row's UUID string from the estate.
